dijkstra.c


Headers and Macros


Includes: The standard I/O library for input and output functions.


Macros: Defines constants for INFINITY (a large number representing no connection) and MAX (the maximum number of nodes).


Dijkstra Function
Function Signature: Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm, taking an adjacency matrix (graph), the number of nodes (n), and the starting node (startnode).
Variables and Arrays


Variables and Arrays:
cost: Matrix to store edge weights.


distance: Array to store shortest distances from the starting node.
pred: Array to store predecessors for path reconstruction.


visited: Boolean array to keep track of visited nodes.
Helper variables for iteration and computation, including count, mindistance, nextnode, etc.
Cost Matrix Initialization


Initialization: Sets up the cost matrix by copying edge weights from the adjacency matrix. Non-existent edges are set to INFINITY.
Distance and Predecessor Initialization


Initialization: Initializes the distance array with distances from the starting node, pred array with predecessors, and visited array to track which nodes have been processed. The starting node’s distance is set to 0.
Main Loop


Processing Loop: Iterates until all nodes are visited. Finds the node with the smallest tentative distance (mindistance), updates the distances for its neighbors if a shorter path is found, and marks the node as visited.


Print Results


Output: After computing the shortest paths, prints the shortest distance and the path from the starting node to each node.
